# Security Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the Barber AI Secretary project to ensure compliance with security standards and protect sensitive information.

## üîí Security Measures

### 1. Environment Variables
All sensitive configuration is stored in environment variables, not in code:
- API keys (Deepgram, Gemini, Evolution API)
- Database connection strings
- Google Calendar credentials
- Instance keys and secrets

### 2. Git Security
The following files are excluded from version control via `.gitignore`:

#### Sensitive Files
- `.env` - Environment variables
- `credentials.json` - Google Calendar API credentials
- `token.json` - Google OAuth tokens
- `*.key`, `*.pem`, `*.p12` - Certificate and key files

#### Planning Documents (Not needed for app functionality)
- `next_steps.txt`
- `configura√ß√µes_manuais.txt`
- `plano_de_implantacao_easypanel.txt`
- `gemini.md`
- `GUIA_DE_CONFIGURACAO_FINAL.md`
- `SERVICE_DURATION_GUIDE.md`

#### Generated Files
- `__pycache__/`
- `*.log`
- `*.db`, `*.sqlite`
- Temporary files

### 3. Input Validation
- All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries
- XSS prevention through proper output encoding
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse

### 4. Error Handling
- Comprehensive error handling prevents information leakage
- Generic error messages for users
- Detailed logging for debugging (without sensitive data)
- Graceful degradation on failures

### 5. API Security
- HTTPS enforcement for production
- API key validation
- Request signing where applicable
- Timeout handling

### 6. Database Security
- Connection pooling with proper limits
- Parameterized queries only
- No sensitive data in logs
- Secure connection strings

## üö® Security Checklist

Before deploying to production, ensure:

### Environment Variables
- [ ] All API keys are set as environment variables
- [ ] No hardcoded credentials in code
- [ ] Database connection string is secure
- [ ] Google Calendar credentials are properly configured

### File Security
- [ ] `.env` file is not committed to Git
- [ ] `credentials.json` is not in repository
- [ ] `token.json` is not in repository
- [ ] Planning documents are excluded from version control

### Code Security
- [ ] No API keys in source code
- [ ] Input validation implemented
- [ ] Error handling prevents data leakage
- [ ] Rate limiting configured

### Infrastructure Security
- [ ] HTTPS enabled for webhooks
- [ ] Firewall rules configured
- [ ] Database access restricted
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting set up

## üîß Security Configuration

### Environment Variables Required
```bash
# API Keys
DEEPGRAM_API_KEY="your_deepgram_key"
GEMINI_API_KEY="your_gemini_key"
EVOLUTION_API_INSTANCE_KEY="your_evolution_key"

# URLs and Endpoints
EVOLUTION_API_BASE_URL="https://your-evolution-api.com"
GOOGLE_CALENDAR_CREDENTIALS_PATH="/path/to/credentials.json"

# Database
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@host:port/db"
```

### Production Deployment Security
1. **Use HTTPS**: All webhook endpoints must use HTTPS
2. **Secure Headers**: Implement security headers (HSTS, CSP, etc.)
3. **Firewall**: Configure firewall to allow only necessary ports
4. **Database**: Use production-grade database with proper access controls
5. **Monitoring**: Set up security monitoring and alerting
6. **Backups**: Regular secure backups of configuration and data

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices

### For Developers
1. Never commit sensitive files to Git
2. Use environment variables for all secrets
3. Validate all user inputs
4. Implement proper error handling
5. Use HTTPS in production
6. Regular security updates

### For Deployment
1. Use secure hosting platforms
2. Configure environment variables securely
3. Enable monitoring and logging
4. Regular security audits
5. Keep dependencies updated
6. Use strong passwords and keys

### For Maintenance
1. Regular security updates
2. Monitor for suspicious activity
3. Backup configuration securely
4. Review access logs
5. Update API keys periodically
6. Test security measures regularly

## üö® Incident Response

### If a Security Issue is Discovered
1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Rotate all API keys
   - Review access logs
   - Check for unauthorized access
   - Update affected systems

2. **Investigation**
   - Document the incident
   - Identify root cause
   - Assess impact
   - Implement fixes

3. **Prevention**
   - Update security measures
   - Review procedures
   - Train team members
   - Update documentation

## üìû Security Contact

For security issues or questions:
- Create a private issue on GitHub
- Contact the development team
- Follow incident response procedures

## üîÑ Security Updates

This security documentation is regularly updated to reflect:
- New security measures
- Updated best practices
- Security incident learnings
- Infrastructure changes
